This is the App, which represents out project in the DTU course CDIO.

## Getting Started (Only on Windows)

Before running the app, it is important to do a few things:
1. Run the install.bat script.
2. Delete the pubspec.lock file, and run 'flutter pub get'.
3. Import the two models card_aug_v1_best-416.tflite and card_aug_v1_best-512.tflite. These are too large to be placed in this repository.

Afterwards, the project should be ready to run.
